# Neural-Network
This is a part of course works for 10-601 Introduction to Machine Learning. The model labels images of handwritten letters by implementing a Neural Network from scratch. Implemented all of the functions needed to initialize, train, evaluate, and make predictions with the network. Dataset used here  a subset of an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) dataset. This data includes images of all 26 handwritten letters; for this assignment specifically, subset will include only the letters “a,” “e,” “g,” “i,” “l,” “n,” “o,” “r,” “t,” and “u.” Each row contains 129 columns separated by commas. The first column contains the label and columns 2 to 129 represent the pixel values of a 16 × 8 image in a row major format. Label 0 corresponds to “a,” 1 to “e,” 2 to “g,” 3 to “i,” 4 to “l,” 5 to “n,” 6 to “o,” 7 to “r,” 8 to “t,” and 9 to “u.”
